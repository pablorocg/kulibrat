# 1. Introduction  
- **Background:**  
  - Discuss the relevance of AI in board games.
  - Introduce Kulibrat, emphasizing its moderate complexity and unique rules.
- **Problem Statement:**  
  - Define the challenge of designing an effective AI for a game with a moderately large state space.
- **Motivation:**  
  - Explain why Kulibrat is an interesting case study (e.g., unique move types, reusability of pieces, potential for cyclical play).
- **Paper Overview:**  
  - Briefly describe the structure of the article (methodology, experimentation, results, discussion, conclusion).


# 2. Methodology  
- **Game Description:**  
  - **Rules Summary:**  
    - Outline the board (3×4), players (red and black), and pieces (4 per player).
    - List the legal moves: insertion, diagonal movement (with scoring when exiting), attack, and jump.
  - **Formal Game Model:**  
    - Define the initial state \( s_0 \) (empty board, pieces in hand, zero score, starting player).
    - Describe players, actions \( A(s) \), result function \( R(s,a) \), terminal test, and utility function.
- **State Space Analysis:**  
  - **Board Configurations:**  
    - Explain the combinatorial estimation of valid board configurations using  
      \[
      \sum_{r=0}^{4}\sum_{b=0}^{4} \binom{12}{r} \binom{12-r}{b} \approx 170\,019.
      \]
  - **Full State Representation:**  
    - Include pieces in hand, score (e.g., 0–10), and turn indicator.
    - Provide an overall upper bound (e.g., ≈ 41 million states).
  - **Branching Factor:**  
    - List types of moves (insertion: up to 3; diagonal: up to 8; attack: up to 4; jump: up to 4).
    - Estimate worst-case (≈ 19) and average (6–10) branching factor.
- **Search Algorithm and Heuristics:**  
  - **Algorithm Choice:**  
    - Explain why minimax with alpha-beta pruning is chosen.
    - Mention alternatives (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search) and justify your selection.
  - **Evaluation Function:**  
    - Describe the heuristic, including factors like score difference and piece progress.
    - Present a mathematical formulation, e.g.,
      \[
      f(s) = \Delta \text{Score} + w \left(\sum_{p \in P_{\text{current}}}\text{progress}(p) - \sum_{p \in P_{\text{opponent}}}\text{progress}(p)\right).
      \]
  - **State and Move Representation:**  
    - Describe data structures: board as a 3×4 matrix, auxiliary variables for pieces and scores.
    - Discuss the use of transposition tables and potential bit-level representations for efficiency.


# 3. Experimentation  
- **Implementation Details:**  
  - Briefly describe the programming language and environment used.
  - Explain how the game engine and AI modules are separated.
- **Experimental Setup:**  
  - Define the parameters: search depth, heuristic weight \( w \), and time limits per move.
  - Describe test scenarios: AI versus AI and AI versus human (if applicable).
- **Benchmarking:**  
  - List performance metrics: average decision time, win rates, number of states explored, etc.
  - Explain the procedure for parameter tuning and comparative testing (e.g., varying search depths).


# 4. Results  
- **Quantitative Outcomes:**  
  - Present metrics such as:
    - Average computation time per move.
    - Win rates under different parameter settings.
    - Depth of search reached in typical scenarios.
